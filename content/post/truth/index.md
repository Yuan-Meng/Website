Lately, it's been hard to tell what to believe. Today there may be a new drug that appears be working, albeit on a small sample. Tomorrow you may hear a new public health guideline that's based on simulated curves. 

Yet we do *feel* that we know somewhat. When Dr. Fauci speaks at press conferences, many of us applaud him for saying the truth. When a Florida politician suggested killing the virus by blowing your nose with a hair dryer, we ridiculed him. **As non health professionals, what do we know**? Heck, even for professionals, the virus is new and uncertainty is high.

However, this question itself sounds *outrageous*. The mere act of asking it has the danger of lumping you with pandemic deniers and conspiracy theorists (whom you may want nothing to do with). Not just this, it feels like some questions are not to be asked, especially those related to the Holocaust, vaccines and autism, climate change, etc. 

As a cognitive scientist, I'm curious about **how do we know what we hear is true**. If you ask me, for instance, whether climate change is caused by human activities, I'd say yeah, according to best available science. 

*Did I judge truth based on science?* I'm not a climate scientist and the one piece of climate science I remember is a toy example on the greenhouse effect from high school biology. If you ask me what humans have done on top of the natural pendulum of climate change, I honestly can't explain it adequately. Yet, never for a minute did I have any doubts. 

***Why?*** I want to say I have a radically different way of knowing compared to deniers but like them, I make up my mind based on second-hand information. If you press me hard enough, I may admit that as a scientist, I trust others scientists, especially knowing how selective faculty hiring can be. I may also tell you that all respectable people I know think this way so it's weird or, dare I say, *shameful* to think otherwise. If you protest that this is elitism, I may mumble, nah, not really, it's ... science.ðŸ˜³

I'm not a relativist and do believe many things have objective truths and that the truth matters. However, from an *epistemological perspective*, how is my defense different from that of climate change deniers or people who rushed to buy hydroxychloroquine upon the President's endorsement? For them, the resource is just as reputable as I view scientists and disbelieving also puts them against people they feel affiliated with. 

I don't know (but I feel like I know somewhatðŸ˜‚). There may be subtle epistemological differences but I can't quite put my fingers on them. In Brashier and Marsh's (2020) review paper published in the *Annual Review of Psychology* (see, a reputable journalðŸ¤”), they summarized three key factors that make information sound true: 

- **Base rates:** *"Most people tell the truth so why assume it's not true?"* 
- **Emotions** ("Wisdom in feelings")**:** *"That makes such easy sense! It's true!"* *"I like the sound of it. So true!"* *"This can't possible be true! Liar!"*
- **Memories**: *"Wait, I heard that somewhere so it's... true?"* 

When offering ideas on combating misconceptions, the authors suggested that we make truth as pleasant and memorable as the initial misconceptions. So to spread truth, our best bet is letting misinformation have a taste of its own poison. Still, being given the fish doesn't mean we know how to fish: The epidemiological process behind knowing truth *vs.* falsehood is unchanged. ***Amidst the pandemic when no one knows the truth for sure, what can we rely on?***

I'm not a epistemologist. These are just my random thoughts.
