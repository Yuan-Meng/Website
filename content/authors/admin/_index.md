**As a cognitive scientist**, I study the most powerful learning machines on Earth: Human children. How do they experiment on the world to figure things out? How do they learn from others? Are they just "being children" or do they follow principles of optimal inference like scientists do? To answer these fundamental questions, I build computational models to simulate ideal learners and compare them with how children (and adults) actually think and do.

**As an aspiring data scientist**, I love to apply my skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and experimental design to making sense of messy, complex data and informing critical decisions, be them personal or for products that impact millions of users. Seeking job opportunities after Summer 2020!
